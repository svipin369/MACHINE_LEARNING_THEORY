    "Question 1. What is the estimated depth of a Decision Tree trained (unrestricted) on a one million instance\n",
    "training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "sol 1.  \n",
    "The depth of a well-balanced binary tree containing m leaves is equal to log2(m), rounded up. A binary Decision Tree (one that makes only binary decisions, as is the case of all trees in Scikit-Learn) will end up more or less well balanced at the end of training, with one leaf per training instance if it is trained without restrictions. Thus, if the training set contains one million instances, the Decision Tree will have a depth of log2\n",
    "(106) ≈ 20 (actually a bit more since the tree will generally not be perfectly well balanced).\n",

    "Question 2. Is the Gini impurity of a node usually lower or higher than that of its parent? Is it always\n",
    "lower/greater, or is it usually lower/greater?\n",
    "\n",
    "sol 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "A node's Gini impurity is generally lower than its parent's. This is ensured by the CART training algorithm's cost function, which splits each node in a way that minimizes the weighted sum of its children's Gini impurities. However, if one child is smaller than the other, it is possible for it to have a higher Gini impurity than its parent, as long as this increase is more than compensated for by a\n",
    "decrease of the other child's impurity.\n",

    "Question 3. Explain if its a good idea to reduce max depth if a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "sol 3\n",
    "\n",
    "If a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set, it may be a good idea to decrease max_depth, since this will constrain the model, regularizing it.\n",

    "Question 5. How much time will it take to train another Decision Tree on a training set of 10 million instances\n",
    "if it takes an hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set with 1 million instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "sol 5. \n",
    "The computational complexity of training a Decision Tree is O(n × m log(m)). So if you multiply the training set size by 10, the training time will be multiplied by K = (n × 10m × log(10m)) / (n × m × log(m)) = 10 × log(10m) / log(m). If m = 10^6, then K ≈ 11.7, so you can expect the training time to be roughly 11.7 hours.\n",

    "Question 6. Will setting presort=True speed up training if your training set has 100,000 instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "sol 6.  Presorting the training set speeds up raining only if the dataset is smaller than a few thousand instances. If it contains 100,000 instances, setting presort=True will considerably slow down training.\n",
