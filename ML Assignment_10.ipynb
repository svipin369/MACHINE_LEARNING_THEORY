    "Question 1. Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",

    "Answer 1)\n",
    "In the Bayesian interpretation, probability represents a degree of belief or uncertainty about an event or hypothesis. It views probability as a measure of the strength of one's belief in the likelihood of an event occurring, given the available evidence or information. This perspective is often called \"subjective probability\" because it allows individuals to express their personal beliefs and update them as new evidence becomes available.\n",

    "Key principles and concepts of the Bayesian interpretation of probability include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior Probability (Prior): This represents an individual's initial belief or probability assignment about an event before considering any new evidence. It encapsulates existing knowledge, beliefs, or assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likelihood: The likelihood function quantifies the probability of observing a certain set of data or evidence given a particular hypothesis or model. It describes how well the hypothesis or model explains the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Posterior Probability (Posterior): The posterior probability is the updated probability assigned to an event or hypothesis after incorporating new evidence. It is calculated using Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probability and the likelihood.\n",
