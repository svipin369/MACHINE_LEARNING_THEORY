    "Skewness: Skewness refers to the asymmetry of the data distribution. If the data is positively skewed (meaning it's stretched out to the right), the mean tends to be greater than the median because the mean is sensitive to extreme high values. Conversely, if the data is negatively skewed (stretched out to the left), the mean tends to be less than the median. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean and median are equal."
